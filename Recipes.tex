\chapter{Breakfast}
    \recipe{Crepes}
        \Ingredients{
            \item 2 large eggs
            \item 3/4 cup milk
            \item 1/2 cup water
            \item 1 cup flour
            \item 3 tablespoons melted butter
            \item Butter, for coating the pan
        }
        
        \Directions{
            \item In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and pulse for 10 seconds. 
                Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. 
                This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. 
                The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.
            \item Heat a small non-stick pan. 
                Add butter to coat. 
                Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. 
                Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. 
                Lay them out flat so they can cool. 
                Continue until all batter is gone. 
                After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. 
                When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart.
            \item Savory Variation: Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs, spinach or sun-dried tomatoes to the egg mixture.
            \item Sweet Variation: Add 21/2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of your favorite liqueur to the egg mixture.

    \recipe{Buttermilk Pancakes}
        \Ingredients{
            \item 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
            \item 3 tablespoons sugar
            \item 1 teaspoon baking powder
            \item 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
            \item 1 teaspoon salt
            \item 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
            \item 3 tablespoons butter, melted
            \item 2 eggs
            \item (1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract)
        }
        
        \Directions{
            \item Mix together the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls.
            \item Grease a skillet lightly with butter or oil and do so as needed between batches. 
                The heat is correct when a few drops of cold water on the skillet bounce and sputter, not boiling or evaporating. 
            \item Mix the liquid quickly into the dry ingredients.
            \item Use 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. When bubbles appear on the surface on the pancake and the edges have browned, turn the cake and cook only until the second side is done.

                Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into the onion mixture;

			\item Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. 
                Stir chicken into the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. 
                Transfer chicken and any pan juices into the sauce. 
                Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste.

	\recipe{Saag Paneer}
        \Ingredients{
            \item 1 teaspoon turmeric
            \item 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
            \item Kosher salt
            \item 3 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
            \item 12 ounces paneer, cut into 1-inch cubes
            \item 1 (16-ounce package) frozen chopped spinach
            \item 1 medium white onion, finely chopped
            \item 1 (1-inch thumb) ginger, peeled and minced (about 1 tablespoon)
            \item 4 cloves garlic, minced
            \item 1 large green serrano chile, finely chopped (seeds removed if you don't like it spicy!)
            \item 1/2 teaspoon store-bought or homemade garam masala, recipe follows
            \item 2 teaspoons ground coriander
            \item 1 teaspoon ground cumin
            \item 1/2 cup plain yogurt, stirred until smooth
        }
	  
        \Directions{
            \item In a large bowl, whisk together the turmeric, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons oil. 
                Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you're using the homemade kind. 
                Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.
            \item Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor until smooth. 
                Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.
            \item Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. 
                In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. 
                Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate.
            \item Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. 
                Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. 
                Now here's the important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. 
                Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! 
                If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water.
            \item Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. 
                If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning. 
                Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more melodious, 3 to 5 minutes.
            \item Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. 
                Add a little salt and 1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off.
            \item Turn the heat off. 
                Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. 
                Once the yogurt is well mixed into the spinach, add the paneer. 
                Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve.

        }
    
        \Directions{
            \item Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease 6 (6-ounce) custard cups. 
            \item Melt the chocolates and butter in the microwave, or in a double boiler. 
                Add the flour and sugar to chocolate mixture. Stir in the eggs and yolks until smooth. 
                Stir in the vanilla and orange liqueur. 
            \item Divide the batter evenly among the custard cups. 
                Place in the oven and bake for 14 minutes. 
                The edges should be firm but the center will be runny. 
                Run a knife around the edges to loosen and invert onto dessert plates.
