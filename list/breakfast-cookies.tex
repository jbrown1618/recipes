    \Directions{
        \item Mix first four ingredients in a large bowl.
            Add vanilla and eggs; beat well.
            Add flour, baking soda, salt, pie spice, and flax seed meal; mix well.
            Stir in oats, nuts, and dried fruit.
        \item Oil cookie sheets.
            Make large cookies, using about 1/2 cup dough for each.
            Flatten dough a bit.
            (They wonâ€™t spread out during baking, so you can place them close to each other.)
            Bake at 325 degrees F for 15 minutes or till lightly brown.
        \item Remove from cookie sheets and cool on rack.
            Cookies freeze well, and they thaw quickly at room temperature
            (or you can thaw them in the microwave for a minute or so).
